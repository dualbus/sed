So, the purpose of this project was to solve the problem, *without* reading the
whole file into memory, and using sed (since the question arose in ##sed, in
freenode).

First, I wanted to test some hypotheses, so I developed a small FSM, which is
in the file ``fsm.sed``. After that, ``blahsym.sed`` attempts to solve the
original problem using placeholding symbols. In the end, ``blah`` and
``blah-readable`` implement the solution in sed. There might be some,
optimizations to reduce the amount of characters in ``blah``, and to avoid the,
literal line-feeds.
